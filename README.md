# C# Playground

This is where I'm starting to teach myself C#, doing the classic beginner's programs (hello world, greeter, etc.) and experimenting with different features of the language.

Mini-projects:

1. hello-world - goes without saying! :)
2. xmas-tree - draws a Christmas tree in the console
3. say-hi - greeter
4. cube - cubes a number
5. fibonacci - prints out first 20 numbers in Fibonacci sequence
6. calculator - does basic calculations with two numbers and an operator inputted by the user in the console

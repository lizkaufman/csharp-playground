# C# Playground

This is where I'm starting to teach myself C#, doing the classic beginner's programs and experimenting with different features of the language.

Most of these are inspired by the activities in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&t=9482s), but I've put my own spin on them. :)

Mini-projects:

1. [**hello-world**](hello-world/Program.cs) - goes without saying! :)
2. [**xmas-tree**](xmas-tree/Program.cs) - draws a Christmas tree in the console
3. [**say-hi**](say-hi/Program.cs) - greeter
4. [**cube**](cube/Program.cs) - cubes a number
5. [**fibonacci**](/fibonacci/Program.cs) - prints out first 20 numbers in Fibonacci sequence
6. [**calculator**](calculator/Program.cs) - does basic calculations with two numbers and an operator inputted by the user in the console
7. [**guess-the-word**](guess-the-word/Program.cs) - two-player word guessing game in the console
8. [**exponent-calc**](exponent-calc/Program.cs) - multiplies numbers by powers; includes try/catch error handling
9. [**library-books**](library-books/Program.cs) - creates Book objects w/ class and constructor functions
